            Notice to all Mar-a-Lago staff:

            As you are aware, our establishment was recently visited by a group of individuals who removed numerous boxes from the second-floor linen closet, the DJ booth in the bar, and other locations. In spite of what you may have been advised by SENIOR PEOPLE in the Organization, this event was not a scavenger hunt for a Men In Black cosplay convention.

            As a result of this unfortunate misunderstanding, we will be making changes to some operational processes here at Mar-a-Lago.

            1.  The only reading material left in guest suites should be room service menus, guides to the in-room entertainment system, and remaindered copies of Art of the Deal. The practice of placing Daily Presidential Intelligence Updates on pillows has been discontinued.
            2.  Internet access will no longer include automatic login to the Department of Defense secure servers.
            3.  Flyers featuring detailed blueprints of the Area 51 military base, with alien storage facilities highlighted, have been removed from the “Fun Things To Do!” brochure stand in the main foyer.
            4.  The “Top Secret US Intelligence” category has been dropped from the Tuesday night bar trivia competition.
            5.  The Friday night English-style fish and chips special will be served wrapped in newspaper, not documents detailing the names of CIA intelligence assets in the Asia-Pacific region.
            6.  Under no circumstances should guests be provided with the codes to the nuclear arsenal, even if they call the front desk and say they forgot their copy at home.

            Also, please be advised that Ivan, Oleg, Tatiana and Mei Lin are no longer employees of Mar-a-Lago and should not be permitted entry if you see them outside the grounds.

            Many thanks for your prompt attention to these matters. Any questions should be referred to your supervisor or Special Agent Dixon, Edgar Hoover Building, Washington D.C.

            The demand for contactless delivery has gone through the roof in the last year. This has led to a dramatic increase in take-out and restaurants all over the world have had to make some quick changes. For starters, fine dining and cafes that heavily relied on in-house dining have now been forced to open their doors for takeout and curbside pickup, whilst providing the convenience of online ordering.

            Given the current demand for a takeout, popular restaurant chains like Chipotle and Shake Shack have invested quite a bit in contactless drive-thrus. Sweetgreen, another famous American food chain plans to open a restaurant by the end of this year in Colorado that will offer take out as well a space dedicated solely to in-car dining. Panera Bread has been vocal about how the chain was able to make more sales by adding a drive-thru facility to their existing outlets.
            
            As the need of the hour is to provide food to customers safely, it should not come out as a surprise if restaurant operators start expanding to other cities and states with just takeout and curbside offering. But setting up a takeout facility would require a lot of planning for any restaurant to succeed. If you’re planning to dedicate a small portion of your restaurant to takeout and curbside services, this article should help you get started.
            How to Set Up Your Restaurant for a Take-out
            
            If your restaurant is new to the world of take-out, we have some tips for you on how to make it easier and more effective. Let’s dive in!
            Infrastructure
            
            Initially, it can be a little difficult for a restaurant to set itself up for takeout. It is not the same as providing in-house dining and requires some extra effort. To begin with, you need to have ample space for providing take-out. As a diner enters the area, you should be able to track which order they’re here for. This can be done with the help of geolocation or mobile phones, as they help restaurants access a customer’s location from the moment they’ve placed the order, up till they arrive for picking it up. This saves a lot of time and the customer doesn’t have to wait in the long queue to pick up the food. A short wait time leads to lesser frustration and a happier customer experience, which further encourages customers to come back.
            
            Make sure that the pickup location is labeled clearly so that a customer knows where exactly to drive to. Use big banners and arrows for easy navigation. If you have the space for it, you could also offer a dual-lane system so that more customers can be served at once.
            
            The goal is to make the entire process as quick and seamless as possible, leading to satisfied customers.
            Employee Training
            
            When it comes to a take out, your employees need to exhibit a stellar level of efficiency. They need to be trained to process takeout orders efficiently. This is the area of restaurant operations that cannot afford any kind of mistake. Remind them to double-check each order to avoid errors, as it can be infuriating for a customer to reach home and find out that part of their order is missing. Your kitchen line needs to be polished and professional, always ensuring complete accuracy for each order. Remind your staff of the importance of constantly being in sync.
            Packaging
            
            With a take-out ordering, there isn’t exactly a lot of room for interaction with customers. So, it important to market yourself with the little space you have. Ensure that your food packaging has your brand logo, motto, and colors on it clearly.
            
            At the same time, it is important that you use sturdy containers that keep the food warm and scrumptious for a good amount of time. It needs to be temperature controlled but also ensure perfect quality.
            
            Try to use materials that are sustainable and offer less wastage. Don’t forget to add utensils, tissue papers, and condiments to each order, in case your customers plan to remain in their car while eating their food. This way, you show them that you care about their dining experience, whether in or out.
            Efficient Online Ordering System
            
            Effective take-out operations need a robust online ordering system. A customer would not appreciate waiting in long queues for a food order. In today’s technology-driven world, long queues are a big turn off. To avoid long queues, it is important to have an efficient online ordering system in place with a simple interface. Allow customers to place their take-out or curbside orders on your restaurant website or app. Once the order is placed, the customer should receive real-time updates as their food is prepared. You also need to ensure that you offer all modes of payment.
            
            Summing Up
            
            As millennials make up the prime demographic for marketing today, the restaurant industry needs to go out of its way to offer them higher convenience and efficiency with each order placed. To truly connect with the youth, it is of utmost importance for a restaurant to have technology-driven operations.
            
            While a restaurant could have survived without online ordering and take out up till a few years ago, these features are no longer optional today. They make up for a huge chunk of annual profits and draw in more customers too. By optimizing your online ordering system, your restaurant can experience a much higher rate of growth in no time.

            subtitle: "Everyone uses Gmail, right? I use it, you use it, depending on whether you created a Facebook profile for your grandmother, you probably created a Gmail address for her as well.",

            Just think about all the apps, websites, etc. that you use, and which for you use your Gmail address. Your Youtube account, Google Play, Facebook, Tiktok, and even Medium probably.

            Everything is linked to your Gmail address, and you either use it as a Single-Sign-On option or at least as your 2FA method.
            
            Gmail got to be a part of our identity, a long time ago. Without exaggerating, we wouldn’t be able to function if someone took it away from us at this moment.
            
            Losing access to your Gmail address now isn’t that easy on you. You don’t actually lose your email, but access to all the applications that your day-to-day life depends on.
            
            There are many ways how all of this can go sideways, especially if you think about how Google is getting more and more protective and defensive because of security risks. More security — more chances you get locked out. But it’s a paradox, as you actually need more security to keep other people out of your Gmail — read identity.
            
            And these security risks are a huge problem even on their own — Hackers don’t target your profile on the super new cool app, or your bank account — but they get it all by just getting your email.
            
            I’m not suggesting you should use Outlook or Yahoo. I’m suggesting that we as the whole internet community, and all of us as users and businesses as well — rethink how we identify on the web, and how much we actually depend on a single communication channel; email.
            
            A whole other problem is — how much everything depends on a single communication channel.
            
            If you think you’re safe, just remember how many security issues Gmail alone asks you, and how many checks it has in a place, such as IP checks, your birthday, etc. All of these yield potential for you to get locked out, literally, of your identity.
            
            Think about how and what tools we use and at what scale.
            
            Make sure you use other means that identify you, not only your email channel.

            If you love learning, then in my opinion, books are the way to go. That’s because you get a wide variety of perspectives — unlike podcasts and YouTube channels, where you’re generally gonna get the same viewpoints over and over again.

            But books are pretty hit-or-miss. Some of the books I read are useless. Most books I read, I learn a little bit from.
            And every now and then, I read something so profound that it changes the way I see the world.

            These are 9 of the books I’ve read in the past few years that have completely shaken up my worldview. They’ve forced me to fundamentally rethink something I previously believed, or they exposed me to a new idea that shaped the way I think about the world.

            You can order some of these books yourself, if you want. Or, you can just read my summaries and hope to learn what I’ve learned through synthesis.

            Either way, I hope you enjoy!

            Fooled By Randomness author Nassim Taleb worked as a Wall Street analyst for a long time. He developed a trading strategy unlike anything the world had ever seen before: he used options trading to make bets that highly unlikely events, like stock market crashes, would happen.

            Traditionally, investors make projections about stock prices using financial models. The models assume that the company in question will grow at a constant, predictable rate.

            The problem is, these models typically base their assumptions off historical data — meaning implicitly, they assume that the future will be like the past.

            But Taleb’s main point in Fooled By Randomness is that the future probably won’t be like the past. We have “unprecedented” market crashes that everyone says are impossible — like the housing market collapse of 2008 — all the time. Moreover, the world changes too quickly to use historical data: by the time we can understand the way it works, it doesn’t work that way anymore.

            But most people don’t live long enough to see the ebb and flow of history. As a result, we tend to think the world of our childhood will last forever. That goes double for relatively stable societies, like the United States, which haven’t seen major turbulence in the lifetimes of anyone around today.

            My big takeaway from Fooled By Randomness was, don’t be surprised if something weird happens. The world is a deceptive place, and often it doesn’t work the way we think it does. You can’t always trust what you’ve learned, and you can’t always bank on what’s worked for you in the past.

                Most developers are clever at writing code, in many situations the cleverness is a strength and a weakness.

                Common sense, street smarts and experience can help developers avoid problems rather than solving them. Knowing when to reach for code and when to reject a requirement.

                Knowing when to keep silent, when to fight and when to run and hide gives the wise (senior) developer the advantage over the clever (junior) developer.
                What's the difference between clever and wise?

                Developers spend only 50 percent of their time writing code

                    Junior developers take simple requirements and create complex code
                    Senior developers take complex requirements and create simple code

                In general senior developers are wise and junior developers are clever but haven’t made the mistakes yet to be wise. The difference between junior developers and senior developers is experience, knowledge, and skill.

                Experience is the difference. Once developers make a mistake, they (hopefully) avoid it by making the same mistake in the future. This gives them the opportunity to make new mistakes and over time, developers know how to avoid more mistakes.

                Mistakes in software development can be hard to see coming because the consequences and pain are far into the future. Simple mistakes give quick feedback, you find it and fix it fast.

                Trickier mistakes are something like hard coding a value and there doesn’t seem any downside initially. Later, you need to do a complete release to change the value and you can pay for this decision many times.
                Avoid problems don’t solve them

                    A clever person solves a problem. A wise person avoids it — Albert Einstein

                All developers want to write code. It’s what they are good at and it’s what they enjoy doing. The skill senior developers learn is when to write code, when to clarify and identifying when code doesn’t need to be written at all.

                Junior developers are like a person with a golden hammer where everyone's requirement and problem seems like an opportunity to write code.

                Writing code should be the last option because everyone line of code once created becomes a liability to the development team. Once you create code, it must be maintained and adds to the complexity of the code base.

                In the short-term code is an excellent solution but in the long term it takes longer, increases complexity and adds to the maintenance overhead.

                It’s more effective to write less code, which will reduce the chance of failure. Senior developers know you write code when you must and when you have validated the requirements.

                The wise developer reduces the code created by including only the must have requirements and ignoring the nice to have requirements.

                Requirements can be achieved by changing business processes instead of writing code. Don’t automate everything, sometimes the manual choice is the best choice.
                When to create code

                    You gotta know when to hold ’em, know when to fold ’em, know when to walk away, know when to run. Kenny Rogers

                The wise (senior) developers know when to write code, when to validate, check and not create code. Junior developers are skilled at writing code and they want to use these skills as often as possible.

                This highlights the difference in output but there is a bigger a difference between junior (clever) developer and senior (wise) developers and it’s knowing when to write code.
                Simplicity

                Junior developers want to create code straight away, often before they understand why the business needs the code and what it needs to do.

                Senior developers look for assumptions and validate requirements. It doesn’t matter how well you create code if it’s doing the wrong thing.

                You create software faster by writing code with validated requirements. There is a lot overhead with code such as updated dependent code, related code, documentation, tests, builds, documentation. Sometimes developers go faster later by starting slower and creating the right software.
                Talking when they should listen

                    The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool. Richard P. Feynman

                Carpenters measure twice and cut the wood once. Developers are rarely so careful.

                The wise (senior) developers understand they are the expert in creating software and users are the experts in their business. Creating software is a collaboration between business and technical experts.

                Junior developers forget and listen to some requirements, stop listening and move to creating a technical solution. The senior developers focus on the business goals and processes so they can understand the purpose of the software. It’s only once you understand the purpose of the business, team and individual role that you can create software to help them.

                The common mistake happens when junior developers read the requirements enough to understand the happy path and create that. Later, when the unhappy path and exceptions appear, the junior developer has to keep changing the code to fix one bug after another.

                What seemed like fast progress at the beginning, slowly bug by bug falls behind. A good senior developer creates the code once, and it glides through the environment.

                Senior developers know when to ask questions, when to listen and when to talk.

                    “Silence is a lesson learned from the many sufferings of life.” — Seneca

                Do your job

                Software development needs a team to do it, and that needs everyone to do their job.

                Being helpful is a double-edged sword, it can help the other person in the short term but hurt yourself in the long term. The more you do other people's work, the less time you have to do your own.

                Wise developers make sure the people who handle areas of the project, do that work.

                Developers need to protect their time and push the responsibilities and decisions for the people who handle that.

                Junior developers get sucked into doing other people's work, get stuck and run out of time to do their work. If you do this enough and you keep working longer hours and are heading towards burnout.
                Align with reality

                    “Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself” — Rumi

                Things will go wrong, problems will happen, plans will go wrong and designs will change. You cannot fight reality. Adapt to the environment and change with it.

                Junior developers fight reality, senior developers align with it.

                You cannot stop problems, bugs and issues, but you can prepare for them and make sure they end in disaster. Technical Disasters Should Not Catch Developers Unprepared

                The difference between a clever person and a wise person is really not worth worrying about

            Notice to all Mar-a-Lago staff:

            As you are aware, our establishment was recently visited by a group of individuals who removed numerous boxes from the second-floor linen closet, the DJ booth in the bar, and other locations. In spite of what you may have been advised by SENIOR PEOPLE in the Organization, this event was not a scavenger hunt for a Men In Black cosplay convention.

            As a result of this unfortunate misunderstanding, we will be making changes to some operational processes here at Mar-a-Lago.

            1.  The only reading material left in guest suites should be room service menus, guides to the in-room entertainment system, and remaindered copies of Art of the Deal. The practice of placing Daily Presidential Intelligence Updates on pillows has been discontinued.
            2.  Internet access will no longer include automatic login to the Department of Defense secure servers.
            3.  Flyers featuring detailed blueprints of the Area 51 military base, with alien storage facilities highlighted, have been removed from the “Fun Things To Do!” brochure stand in the main foyer.
            4.  The “Top Secret US Intelligence” category has been dropped from the Tuesday night bar trivia competition.
            5.  The Friday night English-style fish and chips special will be served wrapped in newspaper, not documents detailing the names of CIA intelligence assets in the Asia-Pacific region.
            6.  Under no circumstances should guests be provided with the codes to the nuclear arsenal, even if they call the front desk and say they forgot their copy at home.

            Also, please be advised that Ivan, Oleg, Tatiana and Mei Lin are no longer employees of Mar-a-Lago and should not be permitted entry if you see them outside the grounds.

            Many thanks for your prompt attention to these matters. Any questions should be referred to your supervisor or Special Agent Dixon, Edgar Hoover Building, Washington D.C.

            How can you succeed as a developer? What can you do to make sure you’re always on the cutting edge of a constantly changing field like Tech? How to transition into Cloud Computing/Machine Learning/AR/VR/the Metaverse/insert new fancy field? How can you find the best online resources to learn from? And what role does mentorship have to play in all this?

            I had a conversation with Muhammad Sajid, a Solutions Architect at AWS Nordics (the branch of AWS that operates in Denmark, Sweden, and other Scandinavian countries) covering these ideas (and more). Aside from his work at Amazon, he speaks regularly at several community and company events and conferences about cloud, architecture, and cloud-native software development. I’ll be covering and expanding upon some of the most important points in that conversation. You can find the full, unedited conversation below.
            Turns out I really need to work on my camera presence. I’ll be better next time. But if you can overlook that, the conversation was amazing and has received a lot of positive reviews (mostly because of Sajid).
            Key Highlights
            
            The post will be covering the following points-
            
                Emerging Tech needs boring skills- How does one get into an emerging field? Sajid is one of the OGs of Cloud Computing. At his time there were no certifications and no personal projects in Cloud Computing that you could do. How did he pivot into this field? By showing his skills in basic software engineering. By showing himself to be a top-tier developer, he demonstrated his ability to build scalable and robust solutions. Being a good cloud/VR/AI/Metaverse developer is much easier when you’re a good developer.
                Everyone should start Mentoring- Sajid is a mentor (more on how you can reach him later). He firmly believes that everyone should start mentoring, regardless of how good they think they are. I agree. If you’re at level 1, you’re at the best place to help the person struggling on level 0.
                Building knowledge is essential to a software developer- At the start of our conversation, Sajid talked about Audiobooks, and how he enjoyed listening to them. He also said that as soon as you think you can stop learning, your career is done. Which is super in line with what I have been writing about. Definitely, something I vibe with.
                How to filter for the right kind of information- The problem with the internet is that even if you want to learn, there are too many sources. And not all of them are good. I’ve already covered how many huge creators scam their audience by lying about Machine Learning here. Sajid has simple criteria for picking the best sources- they must be paid, they must offer refunds, and they must have great testimonials. I promise you I did not bribe him to say that. We’ll cover my suggestions on finding the best sources.
            
            This is going to be a great time. Let’s get right into it.
            Emerging Tech needs Boring Skills
            
            As I’ve already mentioned, Sajid got into Cloud Computing before cloud computing was a thing. And many of you are reading this newsletter, while harboring aspirations of getting into Block Chain, Cryptocurrencies, De-Fi, AR/VR, the Metaverse, and other such new fields. How can you do that?
            
            Turns out riding new waves requires tried and tested skills. Sajid mentioned that while Cloud does have a lot of nuances, the fundamentals of the technology operate very similar to the older in-house solutions. Similarly, while Crypto might seem extremely novel, read through the history of money and you will see many similar systems to it. Having a strong understanding of the basics will never let you down since you can transfer over to new domains quickly.
            
            Remember the 80–20 principle that we cover many times in this newsletter. This holds extremely true for software engineering. You will notice that when we discuss software solutions and analysis of successful coders/projects. There are many recurring ideas and themes. These are based on the fundamentals. Spend time mastering them, and you’ll never struggle to adapt to any situation/context. All the hot fields will open themselves to you. As they say in Boxing- You can become a champion of your jab.
            
            As a tangent, if someone preaches things like ‘7 ways to master X’, ‘How to become an expert in 7 months’, etc.- avoid them like the plague. They are false prophets, who will waste your time and resources to make a quick buck. There are tricks and techniques you can use to achieve mastery of something specific quickly. But that requires a very strong foundation, built from consistent effort over a significant period of time. The basics are only mastered with deliberate practice over time. More on this in our section on finding the best resources. Onto the next part.
            There’s only way to win reliably- constant improvement and investment into your education. And lots of time drilling the basics.
            Everyone should mentor
            
            Sajid is a big believer that everyone should start mentoring. There are a lot of benefits both to yourself and others. Here are some of the major ones-
            
                Mentoring people will help you understand things better. Remember, as you’re teaching something, you’re also relearning it. Once I started covering Machine Learning, my understanding of many ideas shot right up.
                You help someone out.
                You’re networking with more people, which has a lot of benefits.
                You put yourself out there, and are forced to develop your communication and presentation skills.
                You have something interesting to talk about.
                You document your expertise.
                You get to learn from the experiences of others.
            
            Last year, I wrote about how Writing changed my life even though I had failed to achieve any of the traditional metrics of success here. At that time I didn’t even have a plan for monetization. Things are looking very different for me, less than one year from that. Just goes to show you, that when you put yourself out there for a good thing, you will eventually gain something from it. Even if it takes some time.
            Writing has been a kind of mentorship for me. And it has paid off in spades.
            
            Mentorship is something that Sajid actively participates in. He gives tons f talks, meets people, and works one on one with developers from all over. I’ll leave his contact information at the end, so you can reach out to him. It might not be for everyone, but consider reaching out. Sajid is one of the best mentors online and he might be useful to you.
            
            You don’t need to be ‘an expert to mentor people (remember in our field, there is no such thing). You have been through challenges, learned lessons, and navigated through things. You’ve had life experiences that only you will ever truly appreciate. Your journey will have value to someone else. Share it, and you never know who you touch. The last thing I expected when I started writing was for a Director of Analytics at LinkedIn, someone who heads billion-dollar projects, to become a reader of mine. If you want to learn more about our conversation, read this.

            If any of you want to come and talk to me, I would be happy to. Just reply to this email, drop a comment or reach out to me on my social media links. I’m sure you’ve got a story to share, and it would be my honor if you would share it with me. If you ever want some pointers on sharing your story, you know who to reach out to.
            Building Knowledge is Key as a Software Developer
            
            Another point where I vibed with Sajid. Sajid preaches the importance of constant education in various domains. The reason that my writing covers finance, stories, and ‘unrelated’ topics is so that you can build a more complete picture, instead of just being a glass cannon only good at a few things.
            
            Sajid shares a very interesting model of knowledge- called the reverse pyramid. Here you pick an area to go deep into (AI for me, Cloud for him) and go into the other ones with a lower intensity. This is something I always share. By customizing the domains to your liking and interests, you will build up a knowledge base that is uniquely yours. That is your competitive advantage, your blue ocean.
            
            As engineers, I recommend the following list of subjects (technical and non-technical) that you must know about-
            
                Math and Theoretical Computer Science
                Coding
                Economics and Finance
                Philosophy + Logic
                Writing.
            
            To know about some sources I recommend, and how to use them, check out my post How I got a USD 100/hour offer at 21[Storytime Saturdays] linked here.
            
            However, as you start educating yourself you will have to wade through a lot of hay to find your needles (good sources). Let’s cover that next.
            Filtering to find the best resources
            
            Sajid has a really good set of criteria to find the best sources. As I’ve already mentioned, any sources Sajid uses- must be paid, they must offer refunds, and they must have great testimonials. And yes, my Newsletter matches all the criteria. No, I did not make Sajid give these criteria.
            
            This is a generally good rule of thumb when it comes to finding the best of the best resources. People giving you free resources won’t be able to give you detailed customized plans on how you can best utilize them, and what you need to focus on. That being said, there is a lot of value in the amazing free resources available online. I share a lot of them on this NL. So I would make a slight tweak to the first part of his criteria. Instead of paid, the source must have some credentials of making money in a related field. Over the long-term (scammers get away with amazing short-term returns). Even when I was not making any money from my articles, I had proof that I had worked in Machine Learning and delivered the results. Any good source will have the same. They will be able to show the receipts.

            description: `
            The demand for contactless delivery has gone through the roof in the last year. This has led to a dramatic increase in take-out and restaurants all over the world have had to make some quick changes. For starters, fine dining and cafes that heavily relied on in-house dining have now been forced to open their doors for takeout and curbside pickup, whilst providing the convenience of online ordering.

            Given the current demand for a takeout, popular restaurant chains like Chipotle and Shake Shack have invested quite a bit in contactless drive-thrus. Sweetgreen, another famous American food chain plans to open a restaurant by the end of this year in Colorado that will offer take out as well a space dedicated solely to in-car dining. Panera Bread has been vocal about how the chain was able to make more sales by adding a drive-thru facility to their existing outlets.
            
            As the need of the hour is to provide food to customers safely, it should not come out as a surprise if restaurant operators start expanding to other cities and states with just takeout and curbside offering. But setting up a takeout facility would require a lot of planning for any restaurant to succeed. If you’re planning to dedicate a small portion of your restaurant to takeout and curbside services, this article should help you get started.
            How to Set Up Your Restaurant for a Take-out
            
            If your restaurant is new to the world of take-out, we have some tips for you on how to make it easier and more effective. Let’s dive in!
            Infrastructure
            
            Initially, it can be a little difficult for a restaurant to set itself up for takeout. It is not the same as providing in-house dining and requires some extra effort. To begin with, you need to have ample space for providing take-out. As a diner enters the area, you should be able to track which order they’re here for. This can be done with the help of geolocation or mobile phones, as they help restaurants access a customer’s location from the moment they’ve placed the order, up till they arrive for picking it up. This saves a lot of time and the customer doesn’t have to wait in the long queue to pick up the food. A short wait time leads to lesser frustration and a happier customer experience, which further encourages customers to come back.
            
            Make sure that the pickup location is labeled clearly so that a customer knows where exactly to drive to. Use big banners and arrows for easy navigation. If you have the space for it, you could also offer a dual-lane system so that more customers can be served at once.
            
            The goal is to make the entire process as quick and seamless as possible, leading to satisfied customers.
            Employee Training
            
            When it comes to a take out, your employees need to exhibit a stellar level of efficiency. They need to be trained to process takeout orders efficiently. This is the area of restaurant operations that cannot afford any kind of mistake. Remind them to double-check each order to avoid errors, as it can be infuriating for a customer to reach home and find out that part of their order is missing. Your kitchen line needs to be polished and professional, always ensuring complete accuracy for each order. Remind your staff of the importance of constantly being in sync.
            Packaging
            
            With a take-out ordering, there isn’t exactly a lot of room for interaction with customers. So, it important to market yourself with the little space you have. Ensure that your food packaging has your brand logo, motto, and colors on it clearly.
            
            At the same time, it is important that you use sturdy containers that keep the food warm and scrumptious for a good amount of time. It needs to be temperature controlled but also ensure perfect quality.
            
            Try to use materials that are sustainable and offer less wastage. Don’t forget to add utensils, tissue papers, and condiments to each order, in case your customers plan to remain in their car while eating their food. This way, you show them that you care about their dining experience, whether in or out.
            Efficient Online Ordering System
            
            Effective take-out operations need a robust online ordering system. A customer would not appreciate waiting in long queues for a food order. In today’s technology-driven world, long queues are a big turn off. To avoid long queues, it is important to have an efficient online ordering system in place with a simple interface. Allow customers to place their take-out or curbside orders on your restaurant website or app. Once the order is placed, the customer should receive real-time updates as their food is prepared. You also need to ensure that you offer all modes of payment.
            
            Summing Up
            
            As millennials make up the prime demographic for marketing today, the restaurant industry needs to go out of its way to offer them higher convenience and efficiency with each order placed. To truly connect with the youth, it is of utmost importance for a restaurant to have technology-driven operations.
            
            While a restaurant could have survived without online ordering and take out up till a few years ago, these features are no longer optional today. They make up for a huge chunk of annual profits and draw in more customers too. By optimizing your online ordering system, your restaurant can experience a much higher rate of growth in no time.

            Consumers have grown accustomed to the comfort of acquiring whatever they need with the push of a button in the digital age. They now expect restaurants to accept online orders.

            If you manage a restaurant and have yet to integrate online ordering, you are passing up some excellent opportunities to grow your business. Online food ordering offers a wonderful business opportunity for restaurants because the majority of individuals spend a large amount of their day online.
            
            By 2030, the global online food ordering industry will be worth $365 billion. It’s a clear indication of the rising competition. That’s why you need to start now.
            Benefits of an online ordering system
            
            While the proverb ‘old is gold’ holds true in most cases, it isn’t the case when it comes to food ordering. People are always on the lookout for something new, SOME respite from their busy schedules and they highly appreciate online food ordering.
            
            It simplifies getting a steaming meal for customers and also opens up a ton of opportunities for your restaurant business.
            
            An online ordering system can also help you increase client loyalty. The key reason is that it makes placing an order easier for existing as well as new consumers. For the customer, this means being able to simply re-order their favorite order, without having to wait in line and having no errors in their order.
            
            Such consumer benefits help to build your relationship with them, which leads to increased ordering frequency.
            
            One of the most significant advantages of an online meal ordering system is the increase in operational efficiency. You can accept any number of orders at once using an ordering system. There is no backlog due to a lack of employee availability slowing order taking.
            
            All of this results in shorter lines, shorter wait times, and a lesser likelihood of wrong orders.
            
            A strong web presence is essential to digital marketing your restaurant. More and more hungry customers are seeking their next meal online. An online ordering system places you on the map and makes it easier for clients to find you online.
            
            Best of all, consumers are only a few mouse clicks from placing an order if they enjoy what they see.
            What is Restolabs?
            
            Established nearly a decade ago, Restolabs is a trusted online ordering and delivery system for restaurants. It empowers restaurants by offering them an all-inclusive restaurant order management application complete with an integrated POS system.
            
            Unlike food-delivery companies like GrubHub, you do not have to give any commission on every order to RestoLabs.
            
            The best part about using RestoLabs is that you can create a custom website and mobile app for your restaurant to capture direct customer orders.
            
            Rated as one of the top 10 fasted growing companies in the industry, RestoLabs is among the most trusted food-tech companies, currently operational in India, the U.S, the UK, Singapore, the Middle East, and a few European Countries.

            Just think about all the apps, websites, etc. that you use, and which for you use your Gmail address. Your Youtube account, Google Play, Facebook, Tiktok, and even Medium probably.

            Everything is linked to your Gmail address, and you either use it as a Single-Sign-On option or at least as your 2FA method.
            
            Gmail got to be a part of our identity, a long time ago. Without exaggerating, we wouldn’t be able to function if someone took it away from us at this moment.
            
            Losing access to your Gmail address now isn’t that easy on you. You don’t actually lose your email, but access to all the applications that your day-to-day life depends on.
            
            There are many ways how all of this can go sideways, especially if you think about how Google is getting more and more protective and defensive because of security risks. More security — more chances you get locked out. But it’s a paradox, as you actually need more security to keep other people out of your Gmail — read identity.
            
            And these security risks are a huge problem even on their own — Hackers don’t target your profile on the super new cool app, or your bank account — but they get it all by just getting your email.
            
            I’m not suggesting you should use Outlook or Yahoo. I’m suggesting that we as the whole internet community, and all of us as users and businesses as well — rethink how we identify on the web, and how much we actually depend on a single communication channel; email.
            
            A whole other problem is — how much everything depends on a single communication channel.
            
            If you think you’re safe, just remember how many security issues Gmail alone asks you, and how many checks it has in a place, such as IP checks, your birthday, etc. All of these yield potential for you to get locked out, literally, of your identity.
            
            Think about how and what tools we use and at what scale.
            
            Make sure you use other means that identify you, not only your email channel.

            If you love learning, then in my opinion, books are the way to go. That’s because you get a wide variety of perspectives — unlike podcasts and YouTube channels, where you’re generally gonna get the same viewpoints over and over again.

            But books are pretty hit-or-miss. Some of the books I read are useless. Most books I read, I learn a little bit from.
            And every now and then, I read something so profound that it changes the way I see the world.

            These are 9 of the books I’ve read in the past few years that have completely shaken up my worldview. They’ve forced me to fundamentally rethink something I previously believed, or they exposed me to a new idea that shaped the way I think about the world.

            You can order some of these books yourself, if you want. Or, you can just read my summaries and hope to learn what I’ve learned through synthesis.

            Either way, I hope you enjoy!

            Fooled By Randomness author Nassim Taleb worked as a Wall Street analyst for a long time. He developed a trading strategy unlike anything the world had ever seen before: he used options trading to make bets that highly unlikely events, like stock market crashes, would happen.

            Traditionally, investors make projections about stock prices using financial models. The models assume that the company in question will grow at a constant, predictable rate.

            The problem is, these models typically base their assumptions off historical data — meaning implicitly, they assume that the future will be like the past.

            But Taleb’s main point in Fooled By Randomness is that the future probably won’t be like the past. We have “unprecedented” market crashes that everyone says are impossible — like the housing market collapse of 2008 — all the time. Moreover, the world changes too quickly to use historical data: by the time we can understand the way it works, it doesn’t work that way anymore.

            But most people don’t live long enough to see the ebb and flow of history. As a result, we tend to think the world of our childhood will last forever. That goes double for relatively stable societies, like the United States, which haven’t seen major turbulence in the lifetimes of anyone around today.

            My big takeaway from Fooled By Randomness was, don’t be surprised if something weird happens. The world is a deceptive place, and often it doesn’t work the way we think it does. You can’t always trust what you’ve learned, and you can’t always bank on what’s worked for you in the past.

            Generally saying the blockchain is the network on which you make transactions ie. where you send money, only instead of sending USD or any other Fiat currency, you’ll be sending cryptocurrency.

            Before mentioning DeFi and DeFi staking, let’s cover some crypto first.
            Cryptocurrency
            
            Simply said, it is a digital currency in which transactions are verified and maintained on a decentralized system.
            
            To call something a cryptocurrency, there are some criteria it has to first fulfill.
            What makes a currency a cryptocurrency
            
            1. It’s a digital asset
            2. Transactions are verified and maintained on a decentralized system
            3. It must not rely on a centralized authority
            4. Cryptography-secured transactions
            5. It has a limited supply
            
            The last one might not be universal to all, as there are currencies that do not have limited supply, but these are based on some more advanced terms.
            
            Regarding limited supply itself — cryptocurrencies heavily rely on mathematics, by which limited supply was made possible. This practically renders it scarce as let’s say gold, unlike Fiat currencies.
            
            Blockchain is a network, and it’s made out of peers connected to each other, that manage all transactions.

            One of the most important parts is that blockchain, the network and all of its peers, stores digital information, and transactions, distributes them, and allows no editing of that information.

            That’s achieved by having all the peers track all the transactions.

            If you, a single peer, would try to edit an old transaction (ie. Joe sent you $10, but you change that to $10.000), that edit would simply be denied by the network, because the network won’t trust your single-peer information.

            This is why the decentralized networks are also called “trustless”, meaning there’s no single authority to be trusted, but the network as a whole.

            Notice to all Mar-a-Lago staff:

            As you are aware, our establishment was recently visited by a group of individuals who removed numerous boxes from the second-floor linen closet, the DJ booth in the bar, and other locations. In spite of what you may have been advised by SENIOR PEOPLE in the Organization, this event was not a scavenger hunt for a Men In Black cosplay convention.

            As a result of this unfortunate misunderstanding, we will be making changes to some operational processes here at Mar-a-Lago.

            1.  The only reading material left in guest suites should be room service menus, guides to the in-room entertainment system, and remaindered copies of Art of the Deal. The practice of placing Daily Presidential Intelligence Updates on pillows has been discontinued.
            2.  Internet access will no longer include automatic login to the Department of Defense secure servers.
            3.  Flyers featuring detailed blueprints of the Area 51 military base, with alien storage facilities highlighted, have been removed from the “Fun Things To Do!” brochure stand in the main foyer.
            4.  The “Top Secret US Intelligence” category has been dropped from the Tuesday night bar trivia competition.
            5.  The Friday night English-style fish and chips special will be served wrapped in newspaper, not documents detailing the names of CIA intelligence assets in the Asia-Pacific region.
            6.  Under no circumstances should guests be provided with the codes to the nuclear arsenal, even if they call the front desk and say they forgot their copy at home.

            Also, please be advised that Ivan, Oleg, Tatiana and Mei Lin are no longer employees of Mar-a-Lago and should not be permitted entry if you see them outside the grounds.

            Many thanks for your prompt attention to these matters. Any questions should be referred to your supervisor or Special Agent Dixon, Edgar Hoover Building, Washington D.C.

            Consumers have grown accustomed to the comfort of acquiring whatever they need with the push of a button in the digital age. They now expect restaurants to accept online orders.

            If you manage a restaurant and have yet to integrate online ordering, you are passing up some excellent opportunities to grow your business. Online food ordering offers a wonderful business opportunity for restaurants because the majority of individuals spend a large amount of their day online.
            
            By 2030, the global online food ordering industry will be worth $365 billion. It’s a clear indication of the rising competition. That’s why you need to start now.
            Benefits of an online ordering system
            
            While the proverb ‘old is gold’ holds true in most cases, it isn’t the case when it comes to food ordering. People are always on the lookout for something new, SOME respite from their busy schedules and they highly appreciate online food ordering.
            
            It simplifies getting a steaming meal for customers and also opens up a ton of opportunities for your restaurant business.
            
            An online ordering system can also help you increase client loyalty. The key reason is that it makes placing an order easier for existing as well as new consumers. For the customer, this means being able to simply re-order their favorite order, without having to wait in line and having no errors in their order.
            
            Such consumer benefits help to build your relationship with them, which leads to increased ordering frequency.
            
            One of the most significant advantages of an online meal ordering system is the increase in operational efficiency. You can accept any number of orders at once using an ordering system. There is no backlog due to a lack of employee availability slowing order taking.
            
            All of this results in shorter lines, shorter wait times, and a lesser likelihood of wrong orders.
            
            A strong web presence is essential to digital marketing your restaurant. More and more hungry customers are seeking their next meal online. An online ordering system places you on the map and makes it easier for clients to find you online.
            
            Best of all, consumers are only a few mouse clicks from placing an order if they enjoy what they see.
            What is Restolabs?
            
            Established nearly a decade ago, Restolabs is a trusted online ordering and delivery system for restaurants. It empowers restaurants by offering them an all-inclusive restaurant order management application complete with an integrated POS system.
            
            Unlike food-delivery companies like GrubHub, you do not have to give any commission on every order to RestoLabs.
            
            The best part about using RestoLabs is that you can create a custom website and mobile app for your restaurant to capture direct customer orders.
            
            Rated as one of the top 10 fasted growing companies in the industry, RestoLabs is among the most trusted food-tech companies, currently operational in India, the U.S, the UK, Singapore, the Middle East, and a few European Countries.
